# About Me

Hello! I am a recent Masters graduate in International Affairs from the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies. I earned my BA in Peace and Justice Studies and Science, Technology, and Society at Tufts University. 

My research interests include the intersection of international law and technology, use of emerging technologies in diplomatic practice, and security and human rights challenges caused by climate change.
